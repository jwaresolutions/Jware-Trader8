## Current Infrastructure Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Infrastructure Components

1. **Docker Development Environment**
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile for production
   - Development Dockerfile with hot reload
   - Docker Compose with Redis and optional PostgreSQL
   - Health checks and proper networking

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Quality checks (ESLint, TypeScript, security audit)
   - Unit and integration tests with coverage
   - Docker image building and testing
   - Performance and security scanning
   - Automated deployment pipelines

3. **Build System**
   - Production build optimization
   - Parallel package building
   - Code minification and optimization
   - Build verification and reporting

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Secure configuration handling
   - Development/test/production environments

5. **Quality Assurance**
   - ESLint with security rules
   - Prettier code formatting
   - Conventional commit standards
   - Automated testing framework

### üîß Configuration Requirements

Before running the development environment, ensure these configurations are set:

1. **Environment Variables** (copy `.env.example` to `.env`):
   - API keys for trading providers
   - Database and Redis URLs
   - Security keys and secrets

2. **GitHub Repository Settings** (for CI/CD):
   - `ALPACA_TEST_KEY` - Test API key for Alpaca
   - `POLYGON_TEST_KEY` - Test API key for Polygon
   - `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Docker Hub password

3. **Development Tools**:
   - Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
   - Docker and Docker Compose
   - Git with conventional commit hooks

## Architecture Integration Points

### Package Dependencies (Current)
```
cli ‚Üí core, strategies, backtesting, database, utils
core ‚Üí types, providers, utils
strategies ‚Üí types, utils
backtesting ‚Üí types, strategies, utils
database ‚Üí types, utils
providers ‚Üí types, utils
utils ‚Üí types
```

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Data persistence
- **Docker**: Containerization and development environment
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Current Risks
1. **Dependency Management**: Complex monorepo dependencies
   - *Mitigation*: TypeScript project references and careful build order

2. **CI/CD Complexity**: Multiple test environments and build targets
   - *Mitigation*: Modular pipeline with clear separation of concerns

3. **Configuration Drift**: Multiple environment configurations
   - *Mitigation*: Centralized configuration management and validation

### Infrastructure Readiness
- **Development Environment**: ‚úÖ Ready
- **Testing Pipeline**: ‚úÖ Ready
- **Build System**: ‚úÖ Ready
- **Deployment Pipeline**: ‚úÖ Ready (pending environment setup)

## Next Milestone: Provider Integration

The infrastructure is now ready to support the implementation of trading providers. The next phase should focus on:

1. Implementing Alpaca Trading Provider
2. Implementing Polygon Data Provider
3. Adding WebSocket support for real-time data
4. Integrating with the established CI/CD pipeline

**Success Criteria for Phase 2 Completion**:
- [x] Docker development environment functional
- [x] CI/CD pipeline passing all checks
- [x] Build system creating optimized production builds
- [x] All quality gates operational
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks configured and working
- [ ] Documentation updated and complete

## Team Coordination

### Handoff Requirements
When moving to Phase 3 (Provider Integration):
1. Ensure all Phase 2 deliverables are tested and documented
2. Provide integration guidelines for new providers
3. Share CI/CD pipeline usage documentation
4. Conduct infrastructure walkthrough with backend team

### Communication Channels
- **Infrastructure Issues**: DevOps team lead
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions logs and notifications
- **Build Failures**: Automated notifications via pipeline
- **Documentation**: `docs/deployment_guide.md` for operational procedures
